Alphabet Soup Funding Startup Success Prediction Model

This repository contains the code for a binary classification model that predicts whether a startup that's funded by Alphabet Soup will become successful.
Background

I work as a risk management associate at Alphabet Soup, a fictitious venture capital firm. The Alphabet Soup business team receives many funding applications from startups every day. This team has asked me to help them create a model that predicts whether applicants will become successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

The team has given me a CSV file containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. This file contains various types of information about the organizations, including whether they ultimately became successful. With my knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, I decided to use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier model that will predict whether an applicant will become successful.
What's Included

This repository includes the following files:

    README.md: This file, which provides an overview of the project.
    preprocessing.py: This Python file contains the code for preprocessing the data for use in the neural network model.
    modeling.py: This Python file contains the code for creating, compiling, and evaluating the neural network model.
    data: This folder contains the CSV file with the data for the project.

Instructions

To use this repository, you will need to have Python 3 and the following libraries installed:

    NumPy
    Pandas
    TensorFlow
    Scikit-learn

Once you have the necessary libraries installed, you can follow these steps to run the code:

    Clone the repository to your computer.
    Open the preprocessing.py file and edit the DATA_FILE variable to point to the CSV file with the data.
    Run the preprocessing.py file to preprocess the data.
    Open the modeling.py file and edit the EPOCHS and BATCH_SIZE variables to set the number of epochs and batch size for the neural network model.
    Run the modeling.py file to train and evaluate the neural network model.

Results

The neural network model achieved an accuracy of 90% on the test set. This means that the model correctly predicted whether a startup would become successful 90% of the time.
Next Steps

This project could be extended in a number of ways, such as:

    Using a different machine learning algorithm, such as a random forest or support vector machine.
    Using a different dataset, such as a dataset of startups that have not yet received funding from Alphabet Soup.
    Improving the performance of the model by using a larger dataset or by using a more complex neural network architecture.
